я - гуль
Oh won't you tell me, won't you tell me, this thing I've come to be?
The monster that you see, is it a part of me?
I'm breaking down and shaking 'round in this world so helplessly
But you just laugh and grin, completely blind within
 
There's no point now, broken anyway, I try to stop my breath
Even knowing the truth won't unravel me until my death, freeze
So breakable, unbreakable, I'm shaking but unshakable
The real you I've found at last
 
I'm standing alone in this world that keeps on changing
But hiding away, my true self is fading!
I hope you give up, there's nothing left to see
No, don't look at me
I'm standing in this world that someone imagined
I never want to hurt you, so until the end
I'm begging you, please, just to remember me...
As clear as I used to be
 
The loneliness that wraps around keeps deepening until I drown
Fond memories we used to share pierce me 'til I no longer care
I cannot run, I cannot hide, I cannot think, I cannot find, I cannot move, I cannot leave you!
Unravelling the world!
 
A change so illogical, it shouldn't have been possible
But as our lives are intertwined, the two of us are left behind
So breakable, unbreakable, I'm shaking but unshakable
The real you will not corrupt me!
 
I'm standing alone in this world that keeps on changing
But hiding away, my true self is fading!
I hope you give up, there's nothing left to see
No, don't look at me
I'm trapped within this world that someone planned out for us
Before our fate and future starts crumbling back to dust
I'm begging you, please, just to remember me...
As clear as I used to be...
 
No, don't forget me, don't forget me, don't forget me, don't forget me
Shocked by how I was changed, I remain paralyzed
Until I have the chance to find my own paradise
I'm begging you, please, just to remember me
 
Won't you please, won't you tell me...
The monster that you see, is it a part of me?
